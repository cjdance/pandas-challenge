# pandas-challenge

## Project Outline

This project required that we analyse the data from an independent games company and their latest game, Heroes of PyMoli.

All data was stored in a CSV file, requiring it to be read into a useable form via Pandas inside Jupyter Notebooks.

Once the data had been read by the code, we were required to manipulate the data to output a number of tables used to draw insights about the players and purchases made in-game.

The full data/report can be viewed in the HeroesofPyMoli directory, by loading the HeroesofPyMoli_CDW.ipynb and viewing the tables contained in that file.

## Data Gathered for the Report

When analysing the data for Heroes of PyMoli, I was tasked with returning the below information:

* Player Count
* Purchasing Analysis (Totals)
* Gender Demographics
* Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
* Age Demographics
* Purchasing Analysis (Age)
* Top Spenders
* Most Popular Items
* Most Profitable Items

All outputs above are generated as a dataframe inside the HeroesofPyMoli_CDW.ipynb workbook.
